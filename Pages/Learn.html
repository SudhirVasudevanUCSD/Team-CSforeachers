    <h2>What is a Datatype?</h2>
    <p>In computer science, we use programming to tell a computer what to do and how to perform certain tasks.In order to perform many different tasks, programming languages support different data representations(data types) to store different kinds of values</p>
    <p2>For example, if we want to store a whole number such as 45, we can represent that as an integer. Integers are one type of data type that store numbers that do not conaint any decimals. Another data stype is double which stores numbers that contain a decimal or fraction. If you want to keep track of 2 dollars and 50 cents, you can store that as a double (2.50)</p2>
    <p3>Boolean is a data type that store a true or false value. You can only store "true" or "false" when representing a boolean data type.The farther you go in computer science, the more variable you will learn so that you can accomdate many different types of data that you want to be presented in a computer. </p3> 
    <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Data Type</th>
          <th>Example</th>
          
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Integer:whole numbers</td>
          <td>6</td>
        
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Double:decimal or fraction numbers</td>
          <td>3.14</td>
          
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Boolean: true or false statements</td>
          <td>true</td>
          
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>char:characters/letters</td>
          <td>'H'</td>
          
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>String: many characters(phrases)</td>
          <td>"HelloWorld"</td>
         
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>float:decimal or fraction values with only 6-7 digits</td>
          <td>6.99</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>byte:whole numbers from -128 to 127</td>
            <td>112</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <p4>Now that we have data, we can store the data in a name that the data is identified with along with the type of data it is. Variables are the containers that store the data. For example, if you want to store how much money is currently in your bank you would put the number in side of a variable. This variable can be called anything as long as its proper datatype is delcared right before the variable name. To sore yoru bank balance you can write this as "double myBankBalance = 436.67;"</p4>
      
      <p5>By storing your data under proper names and data types, you can access them in a program very easily and efficiently. If your data is being manipulated or changed in a certain patter, you can call your variable by its name and use it in your lines of code. This way your storage containger update your value to its current one.</p5>
